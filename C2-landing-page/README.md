# Landing Page Project

This is a Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanaodegree Class Project.

Started with the starter project which had some HTML and CSS styling
to display a static version of the Landing Page project.

To pass this project it was required to convert this project from a static
project to an interactive one through manipulation of the DOM.

## Added interactivity

* Navigation builds programmatically and scrolls on Click to Section anchors
* Active sections distinguish from non-active using viewport upon scrolling
